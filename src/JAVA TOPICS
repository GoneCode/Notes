### Recommended Study Plan
1. Start with **Core Java** for solid fundamentals.
2. Learn **Multithreading**, **Collections**, and **Java 8+ features** for modern application development.
3. Explore **Spring Boot** and **Hibernate** for backend development.
4. Cover **design patterns**, **testing**, and **system design** for advanced concepts.
