The new Date and Time API in Java 8, introduced in the java.time package,
offers several features that address the shortcomings of the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

Here are some of the key features:

1. Immutability
Feature: All classes in the new API are immutable.
Benefit: This makes them thread-safe and prevents accidental changes to date and time values.

2. Clear and Consistent API Design
Feature: The API is designed to be intuitive and consistent.
Benefit: It follows the ISO-8601 standard and provides clear methods for common date and time operations.

3. Separation of Concerns
Feature: Different classes for different purposes, such as LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, and ZonedDateTime.
Benefit: This separation makes it easier to work with dates and times without confusion.

4. Time Zone Support
Feature: Comprehensive support for time zones with classes like ZonedDateTime and ZoneId.
Benefit: Simplifies handling of time zones and daylight saving time.

5. Better Date and Time Arithmetic
Feature: Methods for adding and subtracting dates and times, such as plusDays(), minusMonths(), etc.
Benefit: Makes date and time calculations straightforward and less error-prone.

6. Period and Duration
Feature: Period for date-based amounts of time (years, months, days) and Duration for time-based amounts of time (hours, minutes, seconds).
Benefit: Provides a clear way to represent and manipulate periods and durations.

7. Parsing and Formatting
Feature: Built-in support for parsing and formatting dates and times with DateTimeFormatter.
Benefit: Simplifies converting between String and date/time objects.

8. Fluent API
Feature: Methods return the modified object, allowing for method chaining.
Benefit: Enhances readability and allows for more concise code.

9. Interoperability
Feature: Methods to convert between the new API and the legacy java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.
Benefit: Eases the transition from the old API to the new one.
