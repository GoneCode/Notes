Here are some commonly asked **interview questions on Spring Data JPA**, categorized by topic:

---

### **Basic Questions**
1. **What is Spring Data JPA?**
   - Answer: Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Data project. It simplifies JPA-based data access layers by providing repository abstractions and reducing boilerplate code.

2. **What are the advantages of using Spring Data JPA?**
   - Reduced boilerplate code.
   - Built-in CRUD and query methods.
   - Support for derived queries.
   - Easy integration with Spring Boot.
   - Built-in support for pagination and sorting.

3. **How does Spring Data JPA differ from Hibernate?**
   - Spring Data JPA is an abstraction over JPA (which can use Hibernate as its implementation). It simplifies working with JPA by reducing the amount of code required for data access.

4. **What is the purpose of `JpaRepository`?**
   - `JpaRepository` is an interface in Spring Data JPA that extends `CrudRepository` and `PagingAndSortingRepository`. It provides additional methods like `findAll()` with sorting and pagination support.

### **Entity and Repository**
5. **What annotations are commonly used in Spring Data JPA?**
   - `@Entity`: Marks a class as a JPA entity.
   - `@Id`: Specifies the primary key.
   - `@GeneratedValue`: Specifies how the primary key is generated.
   - `@Table`: Specifies the table name.
   - `@Column`: Maps a field to a column.
   - `@Query`: Defines custom queries.

6. **What is the difference between `CrudRepository` and `JpaRepository`?**
   - `CrudRepository`: Provides basic CRUD operations.
   - `JpaRepository`: Extends `CrudRepository` and adds JPA-specific features like flushing and batch deletes.

7. **What are derived query methods in Spring Data JPA?**
   - Methods in the repository interface that are automatically implemented by Spring based on their names, e.g.:
     ```java
     List<Product> findByName(String name);
     List<Product> findByPriceGreaterThan(double price);
     ```

8. **How do you define a custom query in Spring Data JPA?**
   - Use the `@Query` annotation with JPQL or native SQL:
     ```java
     @Query("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.price > :price")
     List<Product> findExpensiveProducts(@Param("price") double price);
     ```

9. **What is the use of the `@Modifying` annotation?**
   - It is used with `@Query` for update and delete operations:
     ```java
     @Modifying
     @Query("UPDATE Product p SET p.price = :price WHERE p.name = :name")
     int updateProductPrice(@Param("price") double price, @Param("name") String name);
     ```

### **Advanced Topics**
10. **What is the purpose of `@Transactional` in Spring Data JPA?**
    - It manages transactions automatically, ensuring consistency in database operations. By default, Spring Data JPA methods are transactional.

11. **How does Spring Data JPA handle pagination and sorting?**
    - Use `Pageable` and `Sort`:
      ```java
      Page<Product> findByNameContaining(String name, Pageable pageable);
      List<Product> findAll(Sort sort);
      ```

12. **What are projections in Spring Data JPA?**
    - Projections allow selecting a subset of entity attributes or custom DTOs:
      ```java
      interface ProductProjection {
          String getName();
          double getPrice();
      }
      List<ProductProjection> findBy();
      ```

13. **How does `@EntityGraph` improve performance?**
    - It helps fetch associated entities eagerly in a single query to avoid N+1 query problems:
      ```java
      @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"category"})
      List<Product> findAllWithCategory();
      ```

14. **What is the difference between JPQL and native queries?**
    - JPQL: Object-oriented, database-independent queries.
    - Native queries: Raw SQL queries for specific database requirements.

15. **What is the purpose of the `@NamedQuery` annotation?**
    - It defines named JPQL queries at the entity level:
      ```java
      @NamedQuery(name = "Product.findAll", query = "SELECT p FROM Product p")
      ```

### **Performance and Optimization**
16. **How do you handle N+1 query problems in Spring Data JPA?**
    - Use `@EntityGraph` or `JOIN FETCH` in JPQL to fetch related entities eagerly.

17. **What is the purpose of caching in Spring Data JPA?**
    - To reduce database load and improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory. Use JPA's second-level cache or integrate with cache providers like EhCache or Redis.

18. **How do you optimize bulk inserts or updates?**
    - Use batch processing by configuring the `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` property and the `saveAll()` method for bulk inserts.

---

### **Miscellaneous**
19. **How do you handle relationships in Spring Data JPA?**
    - By using annotations like:
      - `@OneToOne`
      - `@OneToMany`
      - `@ManyToOne`
      - `@ManyToMany`

20. **What are the limitations of Spring Data JPA?**
    - It may not suit highly complex queries.
    - Learning curve for new developers unfamiliar with JPA.
    - Overhead for small, simple applications.

21. **Can you use Spring Data JPA with databases other than relational databases?**
    - No, Spring Data JPA is designed specifically for relational databases. For non-relational databases, Spring provides other modules like Spring Data MongoDB or Spring Data Cassandra.

22. **How do you handle auditing in Spring Data JPA?**
    - Enable auditing with `@EnableJpaAuditing` and use annotations like `@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate`, `@CreatedBy`, and `@LastModifiedBy`.

### **Scenario-Based Questions**
23. **You need to fetch products along with their categories. How would you handle this in Spring Data JPA?**
    - Use `JOIN FETCH` or `@EntityGraph` to fetch related entities in a single query.

24. **How would you debug and resolve a LazyInitializationException?**
    - Ensure the session is open when accessing lazy-loaded entities.
    - Use `@Transactional` or fetch the related data eagerly when necessary.

25. **How would you implement soft deletes in Spring Data JPA?**
    - Add a `boolean isDeleted` field to the entity and filter queries to exclude deleted records.
