The **time complexity of a `HashMap` in Java** is determined by the operations you perform on it, with the underlying hash table data structure being responsible for its efficiency. Here's a breakdown of the time complexities for common `HashMap` operations:

---

### **1. `put(key, value)`**
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) **(on average)**.
  - **Reason**: The `HashMap` uses a hash function to determine the index (bucket) where the key-value pair will be stored. Since hash operations and array indexing are constant-time operations, inserting a key-value pair is usually O(1).
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) if there are many hash collisions, which would cause all entries to be stored in the same bucket, forming a linked list. However, Java's `HashMap` minimizes collisions using techniques like **re-hashing** and **bucket resizing**, so O(n) is rare in practice.

---

### **2. `get(key)`**
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) **(on average)**.
  - **Reason**: The key is hashed to find its corresponding bucket, and the value can be retrieved directly from that bucket.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) in the rare event of hash collisions (i.e., many keys with the same hash code). In this case, all keys with the same hash code are stored in a linked list, and the value would need to be found by searching through the list.

---

### **3. `remove(key)`**
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) **(on average)**.
  - **Reason**: The `HashMap` locates the correct bucket using the hash code and removes the entry in constant time.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) if all the keys hash to the same bucket and the bucket contains a linked list of entries.

---

### **4. `containsKey(key)`**
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) **(on average)**.
  - **Reason**: The `containsKey()` method checks whether the key exists in the hash map. It hashes the key, locates the bucket, and looks for the key within that bucket.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n) in the case of hash collisions (e.g., when multiple keys map to the same bucket).

---

### **5. `containsValue(value)`**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).
  - **Reason**: To check if a value exists in the map, you must iterate through all the entries, as values are not indexed like keys.
  - **Note**: This operation has a linear time complexity because you might need to look at every key-value pair in the map.

---

### **6. `size()`**
- **Time Complexity**: O(1).
  - **Reason**: The `size()` method simply returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, which is stored in an internal counter.

---

### **7. `clear()`**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).
  - **Reason**: The `clear()` method removes all entries from the map, which requires iterating over each entry and removing it. This results in a linear time complexity.

---

### **Average vs Worst Case**
- **Average Case**: Most operations (e.g., `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`, `containsKey()`) have **O(1)** time complexity on average due to the hash tableâ€™s efficient indexing system.
- **Worst Case**: If hash collisions occur frequently (e.g., many keys have the same hash code), performance could degrade to **O(n)** for some operations. However, Java's `HashMap` uses **dynamic resizing** and **balanced trees** for bucket collision handling, ensuring that the average-case time complexity remains fast.

---

### **Factors Affecting Performance**
1. **Hash Collisions**: If two keys hash to the same bucket, it may cause a performance hit. Java's `HashMap` reduces the likelihood of collisions by using a good hash function and resizing the table when necessary.
2. **Load Factor**: The **load factor** determines when the `HashMap` should resize to accommodate more entries. A load factor of 0.75 (the default) means the map will resize when it's 75% full. A higher load factor means fewer resizes but more collisions.

### **Summary of Time Complexities**

| Operation                | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst Case) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **`put(key, value)`**     | O(1)                      | O(n)                         |
| **`get(key)`**            | O(1)                      | O(n)                         |
| **`remove(key)`**         | O(1)                      | O(n)                         |
| **`containsKey(key)`**    | O(1)                      | O(n)                         |
| **`containsValue(value)`**| O(n)                      | O(n)                         |
| **`size()`**              | O(1)                      | O(1)                         |
| **`clear()`**             | O(n)                      | O(n)                         |

### **Conclusion**
- **`HashMap`** is very efficient for most operations (especially `put`, `get`, `remove`, and `containsKey`) with an **average time complexity of O(1)**.
- The worst-case time complexity occurs due to hash collisions but is rarely encountered because of the effective handling mechanisms in place (e.g., resizing and balanced tree structures).
