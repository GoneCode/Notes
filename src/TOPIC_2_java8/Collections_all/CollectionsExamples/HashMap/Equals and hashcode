In Java, the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are critical for the correct operation of a `HashMap`.
These methods determine how keys are compared and how their hash codes are computed, which directly affects the efficiency and correctness of the `HashMap`.

### **Importance of `equals()` and `hashCode()` in HashMap**
1. **`equals()` method**:
This method determines whether two keys are considered equal. When a collision occurs (i.e., two keys hash to the same bucket), `HashMap` uses `equals()` to compare the keys and check if they are the same.

2. **`hashCode()` method**:
This method returns an integer value that represents the hash code of the key. The hash code helps `HashMap` quickly locate the bucket where a key might be stored. If two objects are considered equal by `equals()`, they must have the same hash code.

### **Basic Requirements**
1. **Consistency**: The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods should be consistent across multiple invocations. If two objects are considered equal by `equals()`, they must have the same hash code for the entire duration of their existence.

2. **Equality**: If two objects are considered equal by `equals()`, they must have the same hash code. However, having the same hash code doesnâ€™t guarantee that two objects are equal (since hash collisions can happen), but objects that are not equal should have different hash codes to reduce collisions.

### **Steps to Implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` Correctly**

1. **Override `equals()` method**: This method should compare the relevant fields of the object to check if they are equal.

2. **Override `hashCode()` method**: This method should compute the hash code based on the same fields used in `equals()`.
The `hashCode()` method should return a unique integer for different objects but should return the same value for objects that are considered equal by `equals()`.

### **Example: Writing Good `equals()` and `hashCode()`**

Letâ€™s take an example of a `Person` class with `name` and `age` as the fields.

```java
import java.util.Objects;

public class Person {
    private TOPIC_1.javaOOPSConcepts.String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(TOPIC_1.javaOOPSConcepts.String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public TOPIC_1.javaOOPSConcepts.String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Overriding equals() method
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true; // Check for reference equality
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false; // Check for null and different class types
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return age == person.age && Objects.equals(name, person.name); // Compare fields
    }

    // Overriding hashCode() method
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age); // Generate hash code based on fields
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(TOPIC_1.javaOOPSConcepts.String[] args) {
        // Create HashMap
        java.util.HashMap<Person, TOPIC_1.javaOOPSConcepts.String> map = new java.util.HashMap<>();

        // Create Person objects
        Person p1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        Person p2 = new Person("Bob", 25);
        Person p3 = new Person("Alice", 30); // Same as p1 (equal but different object)

        // Put the objects in the map
        map.put(p1, "Engineer");
        map.put(p2, "Doctor");
        map.put(p3, "Artist"); // p3 has the same name and age as p1, so they are equal

        // Test retrieval
        System.out.println(map.get(p1)); // Should print "Engineer"
        System.out.println(map.get(p3)); // Should print "Engineer", because p1 and p3 are equal
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **`equals()` method**:
   - First, we check if the current object (`this`) is the same as the passed object (`obj`). If they are the same, we return `true`.
   - Then, we check if the passed object is `null` or of a different class. If so, we return `false`.
   - Finally, we compare the fields (`name` and `age`) using `Objects.equals()` for `name` (to handle `null` values) and direct comparison for `age`.

2. **`hashCode()` method**:
   - We use `Objects.hash()` to generate a hash code based on the `name` and `age` fields. This method combines the hash codes of the fields and returns a single integer hash code for the object.

### **Key Points**
- **Symmetry**: If `a.equals(b)` is `true`, then `b.equals(a)` must also be `true`.
- **Transitivity**: If `a.equals(b)` and `b.equals(c)` are both `true`, then `a.equals(c)` must also be `true`.
- **Consistency**: If two objects are equal, calling `equals()` on them multiple times should consistently return the same result.
- **Null Comparison**: An object must not be equal to `null`, and `null.equals()` will throw a `NullPointerException`.

### **Java Best Practices for `equals()` and `hashCode()`**
- **Use `Objects.equals()`** for comparing fields. This handles null values gracefully.
- **Use `Objects.hash()`** for generating a hash code based on multiple fields. This avoids manual calculation of the hash code and is more readable.
- If the class has a **single field** that defines equality, you can implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` based on that field. However, for classes with multiple fields, include all relevant fields that define equality in both methods.

### **Testing the Code**

When you run the code, the following happens:
1. `p1` and `p3` are considered equal because they have the same `name` and `age`.
2. When you put `p1` and `p3` into the map, the `hashCode()` for both will be the same, and the `equals()` method will confirm they are equal.
3. The value associated with `p1` ("Engineer") is also accessible through `p3` since `p1` and `p3` are considered equal.

### **Final Thoughts**
- Always override **both** `equals()` and `hashCode()` together to maintain the contract between them.
- Pay careful attention to performance, especially in hash-based collections like `HashMap`, where a bad `hashCode()` can lead to performance degradation due to collisions.
