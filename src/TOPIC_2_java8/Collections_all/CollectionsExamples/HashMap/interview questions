For a **5-year experienced Java developer**, interview questions on `HashMap` would likely test your understanding of how hash maps work under the hood, as well as your ability to use them effectively in real-world scenarios. Here are some advanced `HashMap` interview questions along with possible areas of focus:

### **1. Explain the internal working of `HashMap` in Java.**
- **What to focus on**:
  - How keys are hashed (using `hashCode()` and `equals()`).
  - The role of buckets and the internal array.
  - Handling of collisions (separate chaining and treeification).
  - Rehashing (when the capacity of the map increases and how it affects performance).

### **2. What is the time complexity of `get()`, `put()`, and `remove()` operations in a `HashMap`?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - Average case time complexity: O(1).
  - Worst case time complexity: O(n) (when all keys collide into the same bucket).
  - How rehashing affects performance.
  - How treeification optimizes performance in the case of many collisions.

### **3. How does `HashMap` handle null keys and values?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - How `null` keys are stored in the `HashMap` (always at index 0).
  - The behavior of `get()` and `put()` with `null` keys.
  - The ability to store multiple `null` values but only one `null` key.

### **4. What would happen if you do not override `equals()` and `hashCode()` in custom objects used as keys in a `HashMap`?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - If `equals()` and `hashCode()` are not overridden, `HashMap` will rely on the default `Object` class implementations, which checks for reference equality and uses the memory address for the hash code.
  - This can lead to incorrect behavior when using objects as keys because two logically equal objects might not be considered equal by the `HashMap` if they donâ€™t have the same hash code.

### **5. How does resizing (rehashing) work in a `HashMap`?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - The default load factor and how it affects resizing.
  - When rehashing occurs (typically when the number of entries exceeds 75% of the current capacity).
  - How resizing impacts performance (O(n) time complexity for rehashing).
  - Why the map doubles in size during resizing and how it affects the distribution of elements across buckets.

### **6. Can you explain the difference between `HashMap` and `Hashtable`?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - `HashMap` is not synchronized (not thread-safe), while `Hashtable` is synchronized.
  - `HashMap` allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values, whereas `Hashtable` does not allow `null` keys or values.
  - `HashMap` is generally faster than `Hashtable` in non-concurrent applications due to lack of synchronization.

### **7. How would you handle a scenario where `HashMap` contains a large number of entries, but you want to keep memory usage low?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - Using `WeakHashMap` or `SoftHashMap` if the values can be garbage collected when they are no longer in use.
  - Optimizing the load factor and capacity to reduce unnecessary resizing.
  - Choosing an appropriate initial capacity to avoid frequent resizing.

### **8. How can we avoid collisions in a `HashMap`?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - You canâ€™t eliminate collisions entirely, but you can minimize them by ensuring that the hash code function distributes keys uniformly.
  - Customizing `hashCode()` to reduce hash collisions, such as using prime numbers or combining multiple fields in a non-trivial way.
  - Proper use of `equals()` and `hashCode()` to ensure consistency.

### **9. How do you write a good `equals()` and `hashCode()` implementation for a class that will be used as a key in a `HashMap`?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - Always override both `equals()` and `hashCode()` together.
  - Use the fields that define logical equality for both methods.
  - Ensure that if two objects are equal according to `equals()`, they must have the same hash code.
  - Use `Objects.equals()` for field comparisons to handle `null` values gracefully and `Objects.hash()` to compute a good hash code.

### **10. What are some of the common pitfalls when using `HashMap`?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - Forgetting to override `equals()` and `hashCode()` when using custom objects as keys.
  - Modifying the keys while they are in the map (which can corrupt the internal structure and lead to inconsistent behavior).
  - Using a poor hash function that leads to excessive collisions and degradation of performance.
  - Not handling `null` keys and values properly.

### **11. Can `HashMap` be used in a multi-threaded environment?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - `HashMap` is **not thread-safe** by default.
  - For thread safety, you could use `Collections.synchronizedMap()` or a `ConcurrentHashMap` (which is thread-safe and provides better scalability).
  - You should be careful when using `HashMap` in multi-threaded environments to avoid `ConcurrentModificationException`.

### **12. What is the `initialCapacity` and `loadFactor` in `HashMap`? How do they impact performance?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - `initialCapacity` is the initial size of the internal array when the `HashMap` is created.
  - `loadFactor` is the threshold for resizing the map (default is 0.75).
  - Lower `loadFactor` values reduce the chance of collisions but consume more memory.
  - Choosing the right combination of `initialCapacity` and `loadFactor` is important for optimizing performance, especially in cases where the number of entries is known in advance.

### **13. How do you check if two `HashMap` objects are equal?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - Two `HashMap` objects are equal if they contain the same key-value pairs, regardless of the order of insertion.
  - Use `equals()` method to compare two `HashMap` instances.
  - Ensure that both maps have the same size and that each key-value pair in one map is also present in the other map.

### **14. How does `HashMap` handle iterating over its keys and values?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - Use the `keySet()`, `values()`, or `entrySet()` methods for iteration.
  - `entrySet()` is typically the most efficient method, as it returns a set of key-value pairs and avoids looking up keys separately.

### **15. What is the significance of `ConcurrentHashMap` vs `HashMap` in concurrent applications?**
- **What to focus on**:
  - `ConcurrentHashMap` is thread-safe and designed to allow concurrent reads and writes without blocking, unlike `HashMap`.
  - It uses a technique called **segmentation** to reduce contention by dividing the map into segments, allowing multiple threads to operate on different segments without interfering with each other.

---

### **Preparation Tips:**
- Be ready to explain the **theoretical aspects** (like hash codes, collision resolution) and **practical usage** (such as when to use `HashMap`, `Hashtable`, or `ConcurrentHashMap`).
- Have a good understanding of **edge cases** like dealing with `null` keys and handling large datasets efficiently.
- Practice **coding problems** that involve `HashMap` to demonstrate practical knowledge (e.g., frequency counting, finding pairs, etc.).
