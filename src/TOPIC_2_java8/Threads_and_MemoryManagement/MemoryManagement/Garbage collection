Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is the process by which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use, thereby preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient use of memory resources.

### **Key Features of Garbage Collection**
1. **Automatic**: Unlike some languages where you manually deallocate memory (e.g., `free()` in C), Java handles it automatically.
2. **Non-deterministic**: You cannot predict precisely when garbage collection will occur.
3. **Mark and Sweep**: The core mechanism of GC involves identifying unused objects (marking) and freeing their memory (sweeping).

### **How Garbage Collection Works**
Garbage collection operates primarily on the **heap** memory and follows these steps:

1. **Marking Phase**:
   - The JVM identifies all live objects (those still being referenced).
   - Objects not marked as "live" are considered garbage.

2. **Sweeping Phase**:
   - The garbage collector reclaims the memory occupied by objects that are not marked as "live."

3. **Compaction Phase** (Optional):
   - In some cases, the JVM compacts the memory by moving live objects together to eliminate fragmentation.

### **JVM Heap Structure and Garbage Collection**
The heap memory is divided into **generations** for efficient garbage collection:

#### **1. Young Generation**
- **Purpose**: Stores newly created objects.
- **Subdivisions**:
  - **Eden Space**: Where new objects are initially created.
  - **Survivor Spaces (S0, S1)**: Where objects that survive the first garbage collection are moved.
- **Garbage Collection Type**: Minor GC.
  - Frequent and quick.
  - Focuses only on the young generation.

#### **2. Old Generation (Tenured Generation)**
- **Purpose**: Stores long-lived objects (those that survive multiple Minor GCs).
- **Garbage Collection Type**: Major GC (or Full GC).
  - Less frequent but more time-consuming.
  - Includes both the young and old generations.

#### **3. Metaspace (or Permanent Generation in older JVM versions)**
- **Purpose**: Stores metadata about classes, such as method definitions and constant pool data.
- Metaspace is separate from the heap and grows dynamically.

### **Types of Garbage Collectors in Java**
Java provides different garbage collection algorithms, each with its own trade-offs:

#### **1. Serial Garbage Collector**
- **Best For**: Single-threaded applications.
- **Mechanism**: Performs GC using a single thread.

#### **2. Parallel Garbage Collector (Throughput Collector)**
- **Best For**: Multi-threaded applications needing high throughput.
- **Mechanism**: Uses multiple threads for GC.

#### **3. Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Collector**
- **Best For**: Applications needing low pause times (e.g., real-time systems).
- **Mechanism**:
  - Concurrently marks live objects while the application runs.
  - Sweeps garbage in a separate phase.

#### **4. G1 Garbage Collector (Garbage First)**
- **Best For**: Applications requiring predictable pause times.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Divides the heap into regions.
  - Prioritizes regions with the most garbage for collection.
  - Focuses on balancing throughput and low latency.

#### **5. Z Garbage Collector (ZGC)**
- **Best For**: Large heap sizes with minimal pause times.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Uses concurrent and region-based collection.
  - Designed to handle heaps up to terabytes in size.

#### **6. Shenandoah Garbage Collector**
- **Best For**: Low latency and predictable response times.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Performs concurrent compaction to reduce pause times.

### **Garbage Collection Triggers**
Garbage collection is triggered when:
1. The **heap memory** becomes full.
2. The JVM decides that memory reclamation is necessary for efficient performance.
3. You explicitly call `System.gc()` or `Runtime.getRuntime().gc()` (although these are merely requests, not guarantees).

---

### **How to Optimize Garbage Collection**
1. **Choose the right Garbage Collector**:
   - Use JVM options like `-XX:+UseG1GC` (G1), `-XX:+UseParallelGC` (Parallel), etc.
2. **Tuning heap size**:
   - Set initial and maximum heap sizes using `-Xms` and `-Xmx`.
3. **Minimize object creation**:
   - Reuse objects where possible.
4. **Use proper scoping**:
   - Avoid holding unnecessary references to objects.

### **Example of Object Eligibility for GC**

```java
public class GarbageCollectionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = new String("Hello");
        str = null; // The "Hello" object is now eligible for garbage collection.

        MyObject obj = new MyObject();
        obj = null; // The MyObject instance is now eligible for GC.
    }
}

class MyObject {
    // Custom class
}
```

In the example:
- The objects created by `new String("Hello")` and `new MyObject()` become unreachable and are eligible for garbage collection.

### **Garbage Collection Monitoring**
You can monitor and analyze garbage collection behavior using:
1. **JVM Options**:
   - `-XX:+PrintGCDetails`: Prints detailed GC logs.
   - `-verbose:gc`: Provides basic GC information.
2. **Tools**:
   - JConsole
   - VisualVM
   - Garbage Collection Logs
   - Java Flight Recorder (JFR)

### **Key Points to Remember**
- Garbage collection ensures efficient memory management in Java.
- It occurs automatically but can be influenced using JVM options.
- Different GC algorithms serve different application needs.
- Always strive to write memory-efficient code to minimize GC overhead.
