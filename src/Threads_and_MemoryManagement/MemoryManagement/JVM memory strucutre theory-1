Hereâ€™s a text-based diagram of the JVM memory structure:

```

### Explanation:
1. **Method Area**: Stores class-level data, including class definitions, method data, and static variables.
2. **Heap**: Where objects and arrays are stored at runtime. This is where dynamic memory allocation takes place.
3. **Stack**: Stores local variables, method calls, and intermediate results. Each thread has its own stack.
4. **Program Counter (PC) Register**: Keeps track of the address of the currently executing instruction for each thread.
5. **Native Method Stack**: Contains native (platform-specific) method calls, separate from the regular JVM stack.
6. **Execution Engine**: Handles the execution of bytecode, either via interpretation or Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
