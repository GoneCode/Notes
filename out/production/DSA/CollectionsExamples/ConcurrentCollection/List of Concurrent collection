Here is a list of **concurrent collections** available in Java, primarily from the **`java.util.concurrent`** package, designed to provide thread-safe operations in multi-threaded environments:

### **1. Concurrent Maps**

- **`ConcurrentHashMap<K, V>`**: A thread-safe, high-performance map where multiple threads can read and write concurrently. It uses **fine-grained locking** to allow multiple threads to perform operations on different segments of the map.
- **`ConcurrentSkipListMap<K, V>`**: A thread-safe, scalable `NavigableMap` based on a skip list. It provides methods for navigating the map, and it allows thread-safe operations in multi-threaded environments.
- **`ConcurrentHashMap.KeySetView`**: A view of the keys in the `ConcurrentHashMap` that provides thread-safe operations.

### **2. Blocking Queues**

Blocking queues are often used in **producer-consumer** problems, where threads wait for the queue to become non-empty or non-full.

- **`ArrayBlockingQueue<E>`**: A bounded blocking queue backed by an array. When the queue is full, threads that try to add elements will block until space becomes available.
- **`LinkedBlockingQueue<E>`**: A blocking queue backed by a linked list. It can either have a capacity (bounded) or be unbounded.
- **`PriorityBlockingQueue<E>`**: A blocking queue that orders elements based on their priority. Unlike `ArrayBlockingQueue`, it is not capacity-bound but may block if elements can't be added or removed based on priority.
- **`SynchronousQueue<E>`**: A special kind of blocking queue where each `put()` must wait for a corresponding `take()` by another thread. It is often used for transferring data between threads.

### **3. Blocking Deques**

A **Deque** (double-ended queue) allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends, and blocking deques allow thread-safe operations in multithreaded environments.

- **`LinkedBlockingDeque<E>`**: A blocking deque with optional capacity. It provides blocking operations for both ends of the deque.
- **`ArrayBlockingDeque<E>`**: A bounded blocking deque backed by an array. Similar to `LinkedBlockingDeque`, but with fixed capacity.

### **4. Concurrent Sets**

- **`CopyOnWriteArraySet<E>`**: A thread-safe variant of `HashSet`. Modifications (additions, removals) are made on a copy of the underlying array, ensuring that reading operations are not blocked by write operations.

### **5. Concurrent Lists**

- **`CopyOnWriteArrayList<E>`**: A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList`. Like `CopyOnWriteArraySet`, it creates a new copy of the underlying array when elements are modified, ensuring that readers can safely access the list while writers perform changes.

### **6. Concurrent Queues**

- **`ConcurrentLinkedQueue<E>`**: A thread-safe, non-blocking FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. It provides fast, lock-free operations for both adding and removing elements.
- **`ConcurrentLinkedDeque<E>`**: A thread-safe, non-blocking deque (double-ended queue) that supports both FIFO and LIFO operations. It allows thread-safe access from both ends.

### **7. Others**

- **`Exchanger<V>`**: A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements. It is useful for exchanging data between two threads in a multithreaded environment.
- **`CountDownLatch`**: Although not a collection per se, this is a synchronization aid that allows threads to wait until a certain condition is met (i.e., a count reaches zero).
- **`CyclicBarrier`**: Another synchronization aid used when a set of threads must wait for each other to reach a common barrier point before continuing execution.
- **`Semaphore`**: A counting semaphore that can be used for controlling access to a shared resource.

### **When to Use Concurrent Collections?**

1. **`ConcurrentHashMap`**: Use it when you need thread-safe key-value storage with high concurrency and don't want to manually synchronize.
2. **`CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `CopyOnWriteArraySet`**: Useful when you have a mostly read-heavy workload with occasional writes, as these collections offer thread-safe reads but expensive writes.
3. **Blocking Queues**: Ideal for implementing **producer-consumer** scenarios where threads produce items and other threads consume them safely.
4. **`ConcurrentLinkedQueue` and `ConcurrentLinkedDeque`**: For highly concurrent, non-blocking, queue-like operations with threads interacting with both ends of the queue.
5. **`Exchanger`, `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, and `Semaphore`**: These are not collections per se, but synchronization utilities useful in multi-threaded environments.

### Conclusion

The **`java.util.concurrent`** package provides a rich set of collections designed to handle the complexity of multithreading. These collections ensure thread safety without the need for manual synchronization, making them ideal for use in parallel and concurrent programming scenarios. Choosing the right collection depends on your use case (e.g., whether you need blocking behavior, high concurrency, or non-blocking operations).
