A **Deque** (pronounced as "deck") is a type of data structure that allows you to add and remove items from **both ends**. The word "Deque" stands for **Double-Ended Queue**.

### Imagine This:
Think of a **line of people** at a ticket counter. Normally, people join at the back and leave from the front, right? But with a deque, people can:
1. Join from the front **or** the back.
2. Leave from the front **or** the back.

Itâ€™s like a queue where both ends are open for operations!

---

### Key Features:
1. **Double-ended**: You can insert or remove elements from both ends (front and back).
2. **Flexible**: Can behave like:
   - A **queue** (First In, First Out - FIFO) when you use only one end for insertion and the other for removal.
   - A **stack** (Last In, First Out - LIFO) when you use only one end for both insertion and removal.

---

### Example in Real Life:
- A **deque** is like a **deck of cards**:
  - You can add a card to the top or bottom.
  - You can remove a card from the top or bottom.

### Operations on a Deque:
1. **Insert at both ends**:
   - `addFirst(item)` or `addLast(item)`
2. **Remove from both ends**:
   - `removeFirst()` or `removeLast()`
3. **View elements at both ends**:
   - `peekFirst()` or `peekLast()`

### Example in Code (Java):
```java
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

public class DequeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

        // Add elements to both ends
        deque.addFirst("Front");
        deque.addLast("Back");

        // View elements
        System.out.println("First element: " + deque.peekFirst()); // Output: Front
        System.out.println("Last element: " + deque.peekLast());   // Output: Back

        // Remove elements from both ends
        deque.removeFirst(); // Removes "Front"
        deque.removeLast();  // Removes "Back"

        System.out.println("Deque is empty: " + deque.isEmpty()); // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Why Use a Deque?
1. **Flexibility**: It can be used as a queue, stack, or both.
2. **Efficiency**: Operations at both ends are fast (constant time).
