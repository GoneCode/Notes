Letâ€™s start with **SQL Basics**, which are foundational for understanding and using SQL effectively.
You can follow along with these examples in MySQL Workbench.

### 1. **What is SQL?**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to:
- Create and modify database structures.
- Insert, retrieve, update, and delete data.
- Perform queries and manage permissions.

---

### 2. **Common SQL Statements**
SQL is divided into different categories based on functionality:
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Defines or alters the structure of a database.
  - Examples: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Handles data operations.
  - Examples: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Manages permissions.
  - Examples: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Manages transactions.
  - Examples: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`

### 3. **Creating a Database and Table**
#### Create a Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
USE CompanyDB; -- Switch to the new database
```

#### Create a Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

---

### 4. **Inserting Data**
Use the `INSERT` statement to add rows to the table.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (name, position, salary, hire_date)
VALUES ('Alice', 'Developer', 70000.00, '2023-01-15'),
       ('Bob', 'Manager', 90000.00, '2022-11-01');
```

---

### 5. **Retrieving Data**
Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data.

#### Retrieve All Columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### Retrieve Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM Employees;
```

#### Filter Data with `WHERE`
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE position = 'Developer';
```

#### Sort Data with `ORDER BY`
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

---

### 6. **Updating Data**
Use the `UPDATE` statement to modify existing records.

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET salary = 75000.00
WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

---

### 7. **Deleting Data**
Use the `DELETE` statement to remove records.

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE name = 'Bob';
```

---

### 8. **Altering Table Structure**
Use the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify table structure.

#### Add a New Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD email VARCHAR(100);
```

#### Drop a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN email;
```

---

### 9. **Dropping a Table**
Use the `DROP` statement to delete a table.

```sql
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

---

### 10. **Best Practices**
- Always use the `USE` command to ensure you're working in the correct database.
- Start with small datasets for practice to understand how commands work.
- Back up your data before using commands like `DELETE`, `DROP`, or `TRUNCATE`.
