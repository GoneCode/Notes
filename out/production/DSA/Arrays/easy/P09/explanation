Sure! Let's break down the concept of the Fibonacci number.

### Problem Statement
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted as `F(n)`, form a sequence called the Fibonacci sequence. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:
- `F(0) = 0`
- `F(1) = 1`
- `F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)` for `n > 1`

### Example
- **Input**: `n = 4`
- **Output**: `3`
- **Explanation**: The Fibonacci sequence up to `n = 4` is `0, 1, 1, 2, 3`. So, `F(4) = 3`.

### Steps to Solve
1. **Base Cases**: If `n` is 0, return 0. If `n` is 1, return 1.
2. **Recursive Case**: For `n > 1`, return the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers, i.e., `F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)`.

### Code Example in Java
Here's a simple implementation in Java:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Base Cases**: The function checks if `n` is 0 or 1 and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.
- **Recursive Case**: For `n > 1`, the function calls itself recursively to calculate the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers.

### Iterative Approach
An iterative approach can be more efficient as it avoids the overhead of recursive calls.

### Code Example in Java (Iterative Approach)
```java
public class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int a = 0, b = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int temp = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = temp;
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Iterative Code
- **Initialization**: Start with `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
- **Loop**: Iterate from 2 to `n`, updating `a` and `b` to the next Fibonacci numbers.
- **Return**: After the loop, `b` contains the Fibonacci number `F(n)`.
