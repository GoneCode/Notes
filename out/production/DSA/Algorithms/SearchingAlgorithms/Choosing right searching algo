Choosing the Right Algorithm:
1.) For unsorted data: Linear Search is your only option.
2.) For sorted data: Binary Search is the most efficient choice.
3.) For specific data distributions: Interpolation Search can be faster than Binary Search.
4.) For large sorted arrays: Jump Search can be faster than Linear Search.
5.) For frequent lookups: Hashing provides the fastest access times.
